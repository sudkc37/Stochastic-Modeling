<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
  This research develops and validates an analytical framework for revenue optimization in capacity constrained service businesses using M/M/1/1 queuing theory. I modeled a small lawn care business facing stochastic customer demand where limited service capacity necessitates rejection of arriving contracts when busy. Using continuous-time Markov chain analysis and renewal theory, we derive closed-form expressions for expected revenue, lost revenue from rejections, and optimal service rates. I use Monte Carlo simulations with 100 independent replications to validate the theoretical model with errors below 1% across all performance metrics. Sensitivity analysis reveals an inverted U-shaped relationship between arrival rate and net revenue which identifies optimal operating regimes. For the base case (λ=2.0, μ=3.0), the model predicts 40% system utilization and $460/time net revenue, with 40% of arriving contracts rejected. The framework provides actionable decision support for workforce planning, capacity investment, and pricing strategy in data-scarce environments where machine learning approaches are infeasible.
